Iris Flower Classification – Machine Learning Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates Machine Learning classification using the classic Iris dataset.
The Iris dataset contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). Each sample has 4 features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

The goal of this project is to build a model that can classify iris flowers into the correct species based on these features.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

Libraries used:

pandas – data handling

numpy – numerical operations

scikit-learn – ML model & preprocessing

matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization

joblib – model saving/loading

🚀 Steps in the Project

Dataset Loading

Loaded the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Exploration

Checked shape and class distribution.

Visualized the dataset.

Data Preprocessing

Standardized features using StandardScaler.

Train-Test Split

Training: 80%

Testing: 20%

Model Training

Used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.

Evaluation

Accuracy score.

Classification report.

Confusion matrix visualization.

Model Saving

Trained model stored as iris_knn_model.joblib.

Prediction Demo

Example test prediction to verify the trained model.

📊 Results

Achieved 96–98% accuracy on the test dataset.

Confusion Matrix clearly shows correct classification for all 3 flower types.
